        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and <br>
         men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of <br>
         the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and <br>
         trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in <br>
         their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking <br>
         from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free <br>
         hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to <br>
         do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain <br>
         circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently <br>
         occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. <br>
