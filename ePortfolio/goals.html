        <h1>Goals</h1>
        Some goals that I am looking forward to pursuing over the next 2 years are the following:<br>

        1. Improve my physical health by exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet.<br>

        2. Save enough money to take a trip to a destination I've always wanted to visit.<br>

        3. Read at least one book per month to broaden my knowledge and improve my writing skills.<br>

        4. Volunteer at a local non-profit organization to give back to my community.<br>

        5. Complete a certification or training program to enhance my skills and increase my career opportunities.
